I have always been a gamer and interested in problem solving. My head is always
full of ideas and I am full of creativity.

I love animals, that's why I have one dog and three cats.

Never been good at math, but luckily there are calculator and other apps.

I run a web shop and sell my art trough it.

## Why development?

I want to combine my artistry with creating new apps and games. I also enjoy
learning new things and challenging skills.
